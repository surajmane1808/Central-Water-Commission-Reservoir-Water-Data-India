# Central-Water-Commission-Reservoir-Water-Data-India
This GitHub repository hosts scripts and data for accessing and visualizing reservoir water level data from the Central Water Commission (CWC) in India. The data is sourced from the India Water Resources Information System (INDIA WRIS) website, providing valuable insights into the water levels of reservoirs across different states of India.

****Data Source**
The repository includes link to download reservoir water level data from the CWC's INDIA WRIS website. This enables users to easily retrieve the latest water level information for analysis and visualization.

**Visualization:** 
With detailed instructions provided in the repository, users can plot graphs to visualize reservoir water levels on both state-wise and reservoir-wise basis. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and trends of water levels across various regions and reservoirs in India.

**State-wise Analysis:** 
The repository includes functionalities to generate graphs that depict the water levels of reservoirs within specific states. This allows users to focus their analysis on particular regions of interest and observe variations in water levels over time.

**Reservoir-wise Analysis:**
Additionally, users can plot graphs to visualize the water levels of individual reservoirs. This enables a more granular examination of specific reservoirs, their capacities, and how they respond to seasonal variations and water management practices.
